Description: This is an external ExperimentData package for LRcell. This data 
  package contains the gene enrichment scores calculated from scRNA-seq dataset 
  which indicates the gene enrichment of each cell type in certain brain region.
  LRcell package is used to identify specific sub-cell types that drives the 
  changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression experiment.
